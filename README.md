Libft - Your very first own library


---------------------       Project goal       ---------------------

Re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. 
Your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. 
Your functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes ft_strlen.
As a bonus I also worked on list functions.

--------------------- Technical considerations ---------------------

• It is forbidden to use global variables.

• If you need subfunctions to write a complex function, you should define these subfunctions as static to avoid publishing them with your library. 
  It would be a good habit to do this in your future projects as well.

• Submit all files in the root of your repository.

• You must use the command ar to create your librairy, using the command libtool is forbidden.

---------------------        Used resources      ---------------------

• Man page of each of the libc functions
